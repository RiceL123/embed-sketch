# What the heck is going on?

Hello! I'm no too sure how to make plugins or use typescript - (let alone javascript ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€) However, I am just mucking around with this :)

This plugin is made with the intention of being used in the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application. (I love obsidian)
